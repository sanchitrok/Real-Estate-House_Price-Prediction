# Real-Estate-House-Prediction
Predict the Real Estate prices of houses based on the factors like number of rooms, square feet area, number of bathrooms etc, Create a Web App in StreamLit and Deployed Streamlit WebApp Machine Learning Model in Heroku

Data can be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data

<br>Steps: </br>
<b><br>1: Performing EDA & Preprocessed the data by removing unecessary features, outliers.</br></b>
<b><br>2: Created new columns relevant from existing columns Feature Engineering.</br></b>
<b><br>3: Implemented various Machine Learning algorithms like Linear regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Support Vectors.</br></b>
<b><br>4: Optimized the model by Hyperparameter Tuning to get better performance results </br></b>
<b><br>5: Evaluated the model with metrics like Accuracy, MSE(Mean Squared error), MAE(Mean Absolute Error) to understand model performance </br></b>
<b><br>6: Created a Web App in StreamLit to display the model house Price prediction results for any given location, sft,bedroom and bathroom to choose from </br></b>
<b><br>7: Deployed the StreamLit Web App Machine Learning model in Heroku to test the house price prediction based on input house details </br></b>
