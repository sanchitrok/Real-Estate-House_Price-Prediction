# Real-Estate-House_Price-Prediction
Predict the Real Estate prices of houses based on the factors like number of rooms, square feet area, number of bathrooms etc, Create a Web App in StreamLit and Deployed Streamlit WebApp Machine Learning Model in Heroku

Data can be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data


Steps:

1: Performing EDA & Preprocessed the data by removing unecessary features, outliers.

2: Created new columns relevant from existing columns Feature Engineering.

3: Implemented various Machine Learning algorithms like Linear regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Support Vectors.

4: Optimized the model by Hyperparameter Tuning to get better performance results

5: Evaluated the model with metrics like Accuracy, MSE(Mean Squared error), MAE(Mean Absolute Error) to understand model performance

6: Created a Web App in StreamLit to display the model house Price prediction results for any given location, sft,bedroom and bathroom to choose from

7: Deployed the StreamLit Web App Machine Learning model in Heroku to test the house price prediction based on input house details
